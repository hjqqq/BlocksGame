Blocks Game (with Liam McArdle, App Academy)

Simple block breaking game done with Core Animation. The game is timed; the player has 30 seconds to tap and destroy as many points' worth of blocks. Each block recursively deletes all same-colored blocks in the four directions around it.

Negative points are awarded for removing one block at a time, groups of 2-5 get increasing bonus scores. As currently set up, the optimal group to delete is 5.

Key features used: Core Animation, programmatic view construction, recursion
